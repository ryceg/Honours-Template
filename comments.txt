From Matt:

Abstract and Introduction read very similar … abstract should be the ‘back of the book blurb’, whereas the intro should ‘set the scene’
Introduction should be included in Chapter 1, and noted in contents
Footnotes: don’t indent, and use the Turabian short form instead of ‘ibid’, and remove the line breaks between them
Footnotes: URLs seem to have a different font – the font should stay the same
Fast-fourier is mentioned early in the methodology, although you may want to expand upon this and why it is important – remember you’re communicating to non-specialists!
Your methodology needs to refer to some existing, concrete practice-led methodologies … this shouldn’t be too arduous (a paragraph or two), explaining how you are entering into an iterative cycle of research, implementation, further questions, more research, further application etc etc … and then reference the existing literature surrounding this … useful text: “Practice-led Research, Resaerch-led Practice in the Creative Arts” by Roger Dean and Hazel Smith.
Through chapter two, there are several assertions made that aren’t backed up – you refer to the ‘difficulty’ of performing some of these techniques, and this reads more like your opinion that fact … can you add a reference or two to back this up? (I know this seems tiresome and obvious, but I wouldn’t like to see you get pinged for these things)
Structure of chapter 2 flows well – read easily, lots of great examples, and well referenced
I like the title of the violin piece! 😊 (they’re all great, actually, but I did crack up when I saw that one a couple of weeks ago)
Chapter 3 flows very well
Page 46 ‘considerations for players’ … might be good to have a footnote explaining ‘nodal points’
Half-harmonics in chapter 4 reads well – I think you’re right to expand this approach out to other techniques
I like the structure and flow – moving from the literature itself, through to your implementation, and the outcomes.  I think it works well that you’re constantly referring back to the literature, as well as weaving in your approach
