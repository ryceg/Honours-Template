Additionally, by applying different amounts of pressure, an octave and almost all the chromatic intervals below the other fundamental notes can be played. Empirical data and elements for producing subharmonics, including bow location, pressure on the string, and the age of the string, are discussed. One curious discovery was that a twisted string works better. These different subharmonics for string players will also afford composers broader possibilities in creating their works.},

We undertake a comparative study of saxophone multiphonics from the musical, perceptual, and acoustical points of view. We propose four major classes based on the analysis of the musical attributes and playing techniques of a set of 118 alto saxophone multiphonics, spanning all the possible sonorities previously reported. Then, we perform a dissimilarity rating experiment for all possible pairs of a subset of 15 representative multiphonics. This experiment provides confidence in the suggested classification, since the four classes are segregated in a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) representation. We also find two possible acoustical correlates of the perceptual dimensions: the spectral centroid (SC) and the modulation frequency (MF). Finally, this last representation is explored through morphing trajectories, which correspond to multiphonics that change the timbre and musical interval organization with fixed fingering.

Overtone singing is where one person sings in two voices, the first voice represented by the fundamental and the second by an enhanced harmonic. Overtone singing is performed in chest register. Tuning of the first or second formant and a reduction of the formant bandwidth down to 20 Hz make harmonics prominent. Narrowing the pharynx, velar constriction, variation of the small mouth opening, and a tension of the walls of the mouth cavity are used. Changing prominent harmonics has the effect of creating an overtone melody with sustained tones, tone steps, and trillos.},

Clarinet Multiphonics is a multi-component thesis that looks into the entire area of
multiphonic analysis and composition for the bass clarinet. A literary section of the thesis
looks at past publications and the problems associated with using this contemporary
technique, in terms of both compositional and performance issues. A theoretical analysis
of Type One multiphonics gives an insight into how multiphonics on the bass clarinet work
in a more scientific way and their close relationship with the harmonic series. A complete
analysis of Type Two multiphonics using past charts and new-found fingerings results in
the creation of the new SW multiphonic charts for the bass clarinet. The new SW charts
are fully tested by correcting problems in past compositions by means of several student
compositional projects at various UK universities. Finally, a new set of études and pieces
have been commissioned by composers from the UK and abroad. The results and
successes of the pieces and new SW charts are analysed and can be listened to via
accompanying audio and data CDs.
The results of this thesis provide both performers and composers with an accurate,
exhaustive and up-to-date usable publication. Not only does this thesis provide a new set
of multiphonic charts, but the addition of compositional examples using multiphonics
provides both practice and recital material for performers and useful compositional
technique hints and advice for composers wishing to use this resource in the future.},

  abstract = {By carefully positioning the bow and a lightly touching finger on the string, the string spectrum can
be conditioned to provide narrow bands of pronounced energy. This leaves the impression of multiple complex tones with the normal (Helmholtz) fundamental as the lowest pitch. The phenomenon
is seen to be caused by two additional signal loops, one on each side of the finger, which through
the repeating slip pattern get phase locked to the full loop of the fundamental. Within the nominal
period, however, the slip pulses will not be uniform like they are during the production of a normal
“harmonic” or “flageolet” but may vary considerably in shape, size, and timing. For each string,
there is a large number of bow/finger combinations that bear the potential of producing such tones.
There are also two classes, depending on whether the bow or the finger is situated closest to the
bridge. Touching the string with the finger closest to the bridge will somewhat emphasize the
(Helmholtz) fundamental. The technique is applicable to double bass and cello, while less practical
on shorter-stringed instruments. Analyses based on impulse responses and the Poisson summation
formula provide an explanation to the underlying system properties.},

  abstract = {There was a drastic shift in the aesthetics of music from the twentieth century, and this placed new performance demands on musicians. These technical and expressive demands often include extended techniques, which are methods for producing novel timbres. This study undertakes an examination of these extended techniques on the viola. It is necessary for the modern violist to be familiar with extended techniques, but they are not part of standard training on the instrument, as the majority of the standard etudes come from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and do not address modern technical challenges. Because contemporary pedagogical literature is scarce for the viola and few etudes address extended techniques, six etudes have been commissioned as a practical application for this project. These etudes help to introduce and refine facility with extended techniques for students at an intermediate level.  
Extended techniques are often learned when a student is advanced, but they can and should be taught to younger students. The techniques are sometimes thought of as being unusual or challenging, but they are based on fundamental techniques and can contribute to and improve overall technical and musical abilities. This project begins with an introduction and a literature review, followed by the third chapter which provides a context for extended techniques with a brief history of the instrument and its pedagogy. The fourth chapter explores various extended techniques, the fifth chapter discusses the commissioned etudes, and the conclusion reiterates the importance of learning extended techniques.},

A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, nor the parents', and insists they disable the automation and take a vacation to become more self-sufficient. The children are not pleased with this decision, but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist, who sees the lions feasting, but does not recognize what has happened.},

assimilation of extended techniques and preparations. The research documents the process from inception
to creative output. Through an emergent, practice-led initial research phase, I fashion a developmental
framework for assimilating new techniques and preparations into my musical vocabulary. The developmental
framework has the potential to be linear, reflexive or flexible depending on context, and as such the
tangible outcomes can be either finished creative works, development of new techniques, or knowledge
about organisational aspects of placing the techniques in musical settings. Analysis of creative works is
an integral part of the developmental framework and forms the bulk of this dissertation. The analytical
essays within contain new knowledge about extended techniques, their potential and limitations, and
realities inherent in their use in both compositional and improvisational contexts. Video, audio, notation
and photos are embedded throughout the dissertation and form an integral part of the research project.
Engagement with the media at appropriate junctures in the analysis is intended to enhance the narrative
of the dissertation and facilitate a greater comprehension of the knowledge contained therein.},

by archival sources, secondary literature, and purpose-built
visualization software. This account explores how the
extreme performance demands of the work arise directly
and deliberately from Xenakis’s varied compositional approaches.
The construction of Theraps suggests broader reflections
on the technologies employed and their relationships to the
body, society, and knowledge; a second section provides
speculative readings of Theraps through the work of two
authors identified with the philosophy of technology: Albert Borgmann and Don Ihde.},

  abstract = {Of the many waveforms the bowed string can assume, the so-called “Helmholtz motion”
(Helmholtz 1862) gives the fullest sound in terms of power and overtone richness. The
development of this steady-state oscillation pattern can take many different paths, most of
which would include noise caused by stick-slip irregularities of the bow-string contact. Of the
five papers included in the thesis, the first one shows, not surprisingly, that tone onsets are
considered superior when the attack noise has a very limited duration. It was found, however,
that in this judgment the character of the noise plays an important part, as the listener’s
tolerance of noise in terms of duration is almost twice as great for “slipping noise” as for
“creaks” or “raucousness” during the tone onsets. The three following papers contain analyses
focusing on how irregular slip-stick triggering may be avoided, as is quite often the case in
practical playing by professionals. The fifth paper describes the triggering mechanism of a
peculiar tone production referred to as “Anomalous Low Frequencies” (ALF). If properly
skilled, a player can achieve pitches below the normal range of the instrument. This
phenomenon is related to triggering waves taking “an extra turn” on the string before causing
the string’s release from the bow-hair grip. Since transverse and torsional propagation speeds
are both involved, two different sets of “sub-ranged” notes can be produced this way. In the
four last papers wave patterns are analysed and explained through the use of computer
simulations.},

  isbn = {978-1-109-28010-4},
  abstract = {The impetus for this study was the question of whether extended techniques are actually being taught in college trumpet studio settings as standard skills necessary on the instrument. The specific purposes of this document included: (1) catalogue the extended techniques available to today's trumpet performer, (2) reflect on their current use and address the question of how and when students are introduced to extended techniques, (3) contribute pedagogical exercises and suggestions to aid trumpeters in the study of some of the more challenging techniques, and (4) conclude with a "Guided Approach" to the literature detailing suggestions for the study of the twenty pieces referenced in this document. A survey was conducted of the current pedagogical status of extended techniques at the collegiate level. The online survey, which included questions regarding how and when students are introduced to extended techniques in their study of the trumpet, was completed by 166 college and university trumpet studio teachers from the United States and Canada. Examination of the results offers a unique view of the attention currently being given to extended techniques in college trumpet studios; they provide insight into specific teaching materials and performance repertoire being used by studio teachers today. Within each chapter pedagogical exercises assist in the study of certain techniques. The exercises are written as an introduction to many of these techniques, offering opportunities to experiment with the more challenging techniques before encountering them in the literature. Two specific techniques, multiphonics and flutter tonguing, are covered in greater detail with a larger collection of exercises. Pedagogical suggestions offered by the survey respondents are also included. Finally, the "Guided Approach" to the literature was compiled. Twenty pieces were selected and arranged in an order that provides a progressive approach to extended techniques. Each piece is catalogued through an individual profile which provides practical information regarding the piece: date, publication information, length, range, style of notation used, equipment requirements, who the piece was commissioned by or written for, a listing of all extended techniques employed, a listing of existing recordings, and a commentary concerning its particular challenges and benefits of study. The goal is to provide a resource for those who might not be familiar with the repertoire and help them choose appropriate literature for their students' level of experience with these techniques. There exists a need for additional pedagogical materials that can be used to introduce extended techniques to students of the trumpet. The document is designed to aid the serious student of the trumpet in meeting all the expectations of the repertoire.

  abstract = {This book addresses one of the most exciting and innovative developments within higher education: the rise in prominence of the creative arts and the accelerating recognition that creative practice is a form of research. The book considers how creative practice can lead to research insights through what is often known as practice-led research. But unlike other books on practice-led research, it balances this with discussion of how research can impact positively on creative practice through research-led practice. The editors posit an iterative and web-like relationship between practice and research. Essays within the book cover a wide range of disciplines including creative writing, dance, music, theatre, film and new media, and the contributors are from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The subject is approached from numerous angles: the authors discuss methodologies of practice-led research and research-led practice, their own creative work as a form of research, research training for creative practitioners, and the politics and histories of practice-led research and research-led practice within the university. The book will be invaluable for creative practitioners, researchers, students in the creative arts and university leaders. Key Features The first book to document, conceptualise and analyse practice-led research in the creative arts and to balance it with research-led practice Written by highly qualified academics and practitioners across the creative arts and sciences Brings together empirical, cultural and creative approaches Presents illuminating case histories of creative work and practice-led research},
