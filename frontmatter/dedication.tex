	Thank you to my supervisor, Matthew Boden, and my teachers Dr.\ Maria Grenfell and Dr.\ Scott McIntyre for their help and guidance throughout my degree. 
	I am indebted to my music teachers for inspiring my passion in music, and my peers and friends at UTas who have supported me in my research, and kept that passion alive. 
	My love and thanks go to my partner Claire Farrell\footnote{Whose cakes, biscuits, and mugs of coffee nourished me, and whose support and words of encouragement kept me sane.}, my family, and my cats Buttercup and Millie for their unconditional support.
