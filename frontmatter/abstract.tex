\chapter*{Abstract}
 
This exegesis explores compositional applications of the extended string techniques half-harmonics, subharmonics, and multiphonics.
A review of the literature and resources that are readily available to composers will be made to assess what techniques require further investigation and refinement. 
By researching these techniques and the mechanics behind them, using document analysis, and analysing recordings made, a better understanding of how these techniques can be implemented in my practice will form. 
As part of both the analysis of techniques and my compositional practice, I assess not only the compositional potential, but also the practicality of techniques. 
Reviewing the feasibility and notational aspects of the techniques will render the exegesis a practical document to reference for performance and composition.
The works that I compose accompanying the exegesis will show idiomatic treatment of the techniques and serve as references as such in the exegesis. 
The dissemination of the material I research will contribute to the accessibility of new sound possibilities for artists.
